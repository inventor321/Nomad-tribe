# Nomad-tribe --- In development

Game inspired by a Dark room

I tried to do it only with Python, HTML and css but it took too long and it was too complicated so I added Javascript.

If you ever want to finish the project with only Python, HTML and css I left the files of where I more or less finished. (I might of started adding some js, idk)
Let me know if you ever finish or make some progress with that version.

I used some code from some codepen but from what i know it's all MIT licensed so i believe that makes my code MIT licensed. 
I'll add a list of the people that I used their code.

Link to the current version of the game : https://nomadic-tribe.herokuapp.com/

I'll try to make my game work on the github page thing like The Gold Factory
